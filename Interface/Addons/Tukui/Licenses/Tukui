	Earlier versions were released under terms that did not require permission,
	but due to the actions of certain unscrupulous distributors, I have chosen
	to license all versions over v9 under stricter terms.
	
	******************************************************************************** 
	
	For Mists of Pandaria, some people were granted special permission to make 
	their own edited version of Tukui from inside the addon folder, because some
	things were difficult to edit. They were also granted permission to change
	the AddOn name. Due to abuse, no one is allowed to do this now. Beginning 
	with v16 and Warlords of Draenor, everyone NEEDS to make their edited version of
	Tukui outside of the AddOn folder and keep Tukui 100% original. Doing an 
	edited version of Tukui with v16+ is really easy, there is no excuse now to make
	an edit from inside. If you don't want to respect this condition, then make
	your own user interface from scratch.
	
	This makes me sad, but some people really abused my kindness.
	
	Thank you for understanding.
